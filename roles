What are the changes in your life because of College?

New Role:
	I am now in college so that means I have new roles to achieve. One of which is to be a responsible college student, and also I need to discipline myself to study hard. I should show my parents that their money from hardwork is worth spending in my tuition. 
New Routines:
	Now I have new routines that are very different from high school. One is I have to wake up earlier than usual to avoid traffic, because my school now is farther than my previous school from my house.

New relationship:
	I am now in a new environment and I made some new friends especially from my block. They helped me a lot in adjusting my life from high school to college. Although we’ll have to go our own ways someday, I still hope our friendship will last.  

New Assumptions:
	I assume that I will enjoy this course and I have to be determined and disciplined to study and practice to bring out the best of me and to show myself what I’m capable of doing.
